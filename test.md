The <tt>$service</tt> component MAY be placed after the dataset segment,&nbsp;if
it applies&nbsp;to&nbsp;the entire contract. In that case it would go&nbsp;after

[resource kind](/daisy/sdata/Introduction/186-DSY.html "1.1 Terminology") segment,&nbsp;if it applies to resources of
a specific kind as in the example.
